This is a patched together html e-book. It's meant to allow students to access their textbook in a browser without needing to use the distracting interface that textbook publishers force students to use. With this version, you can print as much as you want, edit the text to make corrections, access the book from unlimited devices, and keep it indefinitely without worrying that a company will cut off your access to the text that you paid for. 

The TOC and Index should work: clicking on a page number hyperlink will open the html file of the whole book and then jump to the page you selected. Footnote hyperlinks within the document should also work, jumping you to the note at the bottom of the page. 

It's recommended that you download these files so that you can use the book offline and in case this repository does not stand the test of time. Be aware that if you rename the files, the TOC and Index links will break.

No annotation tools -- that's something you'll have to use on the publishers' websites.
